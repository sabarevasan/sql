**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

SQL is powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. However, it's vital to consider ethical implications and potential biases when using it, considering the ever evolving technological capabilities. Here's how we can improve to incorporate these considerations:

    Fix Biases in Data Sources: To be aware of potential biases in the data used. This could be sampling bias, where the data collected isn't representative of the larger population, or historical biases that have crept into the data over time. Techniques like data cleansing and filtering can help mitigate these issues.
    
    SQL to Mitigate Bias: Craft queries that consider equity. For example, when filtering or aggregating data, ensure you're not unintentionally excluding relevant subgroups. Examine the results for unexpected patterns that might indicate bias.

    Inclusive Logical Design: When writing PL/SQL functions or procedures, consider potential biases that might be introduced through the logic you employ. For instance, if a function is used to make decisions about loan approvals, ensure it doesn't unfairly disadvantage certain demographics. Use diverse test data to identify and mitigate bias in your code.

    Clear and Documented Code: Document code clearly, explaining the purpose and logic behind each step. This transparency allows for review and helps to identify potential ethical issues.

    Data Tracking: Track the origin and transformations applied to the data. This helps identify where biases might be introduced and ensures responsible data use.

By incorporating these adjustments, we can leverage the power of SQL for data analysis while promoting fair and ethical outcomes. Ethical considerations are an ongoing process. As data practices evolve, so too should the approach to using automation responsibly.
